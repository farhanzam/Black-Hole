# Black-Hole

Open "script.py" and run this file to view the project.

The user selects the Ball or Floater buttons and clicks anywhere on the white space to create "prey" objects, and selects the Black_Hole, Pulsator, Hunter, or Special buttons and clicks anywhere on the white space to create "predator" objects. All moving objects "bounce" off the edge of the window if they move that far.

* Ball objects move in straight lines.
* Floaters move in erratic patterns.
* Black Holes are stationary, "eating" any prey objects that fall within them.
* Pulsators and Hunters are types of Black Holes:
  * Pulsators grow larger the more prey they eat and shrink while they don't eat, until they're so small they disappear.
  * Hunters share the same properties as Pulsators but are able to move toward the closest prey object.

By clicking the Start or Step buttons, the user can see how the objects interact with each other and within windows of differing sizes.

The "Stop" button can be used to pause the program, "Remove" used to delete specific objects from the white space, and "Reset" used to wipe the white space clean of all current objects.

Two counters to the right of the buttons display the number of objects currently in the white space and the number of cycles elapsed in the current simulation.
